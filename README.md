# Book Notes

Repo to store any notes and example code from some textbooks I have recently 
read. Here is my list to get through so far.

* Generalized Linear Models - McCullagh and Nelder
* Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R - Wood
* Regression Modeling Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis - Harrell
* Forecasting: Principles and Practice - Hyndman
* Bayesian Data Analysis - Gelman

If I have time to go back through the ones I've already read I'll add notes

* Elements of Statistical Learning - Hastie and Tibshirani
* Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View - Shalizi
* Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models - Gelman

This R Markdown resource from Shalizi should help with formatting the notes:
